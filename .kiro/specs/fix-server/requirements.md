1. WHEN a FIX message is received THEN the system SHALL validate the message format according to FIX 4.4 or 5.0 specifications
2. WHEN parsing FIX messages THEN the system SHALL correctly handle all standard message types (logon, logout, heartbeat, test request, business messages)
3. WHEN generating FIX messages THEN the system SHALL format messages according to the negotiated FIX version
4. WHEN message validation fails THEN the system SHALL send appropriate reject messages with detailed error codes
5. WHEN sequence numbers are out of order THEN the system SHALL handle gap fill and resend requests according to FIX protocol

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a trading operations manager, I want comprehensive session lifecycle management with timeout handling, so that I can maintain reliable connections with trading counterparties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client initiates a logon THEN the system SHALL authenticate the session and establish heartbeat intervals
2. WHEN heartbeat timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL send test requests and disconnect unresponsive sessions
3. WHEN a session disconnects unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL preserve session state for reconnection
4. WHEN a session reconnects THEN the system SHALL support message replay from the last processed sequence number
5. WHEN session limits are reached THEN the system SHALL reject new connections with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Message Persistence and Replay

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all FIX messages to be persistently stored with audit trails, so that I can meet regulatory requirements and support message replay functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a FIX message is processed THEN the system SHALL store the message with timestamp, session ID, and sequence number
2. WHEN message replay is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve and resend messages from the specified sequence range
3. WHEN storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL archive old messages according to retention policies
4. WHEN the system restarts THEN the system SHALL recover all active sessions and their message sequences from persistent storage
5. WHEN audit queries are made THEN the system SHALL provide searchable access to historical message data

### Requirement 5: Enterprise Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enterprise-grade TLS security with mutual authentication, so that I can ensure secure communication in financial trading environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL support TLS 1.2 and 1.3 with configurable cipher suites
2. WHEN client certificates are presented THEN the system SHALL validate certificates against configured certificate authorities
3. WHEN mutual authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL require and validate client certificates
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events and optionally block offending clients
5. WHEN TLS configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload certificates without service interruption

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus metrics and health endpoints, so that I can monitor system performance and detect issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for connections, messages, and performance
2. WHEN health checks are requested THEN the system SHALL provide detailed status of all system components
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts through configured channels
4. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL track JVM metrics, memory usage, and thread pools
5. WHEN integration with Grafana is needed THEN the system SHALL provide compatible metric formats and dashboards

### Requirement 7: Operational Administration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want REST API endpoints for operational tasks, so that I can manage sessions, view statistics, and perform administrative functions without service interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrative operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for session management
2. WHEN system statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL return real-time metrics and session information
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support dynamic reconfiguration through API calls
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for diagnostic information
5. WHEN API access is attempted THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize administrative requests

### Requirement 8: High Availability and Scalability

**User Story:** As a trading operations manager, I want the system to support thousands of concurrent sessions with 99.9% uptime, so that I can handle high-volume trading without service disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN under normal load THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation under stress
2. WHEN concurrent sessions increase THEN the system SHALL scale to support thousands of simultaneous connections
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical sessions and throttle non-essential operations
