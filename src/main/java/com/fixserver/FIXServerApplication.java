 * - Comprehensive message persistence and replay functionality
 * - Real-time monitoring with Prometheus metrics
 * - Regulatory compliance with full audit trails
 * 
 * Architecture Features:
 * - Spring Boot framework for enterprise integration
 * - Asynchronous processing for high throughput
 * - Scheduled tasks for heartbeat and timeout management
 * - Graceful shutdown with connection cleanup
 * - Multi-environment configuration support
 * 
 * Operational Excellence:
 * - Docker containerization ready
 * - Kubernetes deployment support
 * - Comprehensive health checks
 * - Performance monitoring and alerting
 * - Automated backup and recovery
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - TLS 1.2/1.3 with strong cipher suites
